            My favorite place to visit has to be the Cardboard 
            Cafe in my hometown of Raymore Missouri. Its has 
            good waffles that I can enjoy while playing board 
            games with my friends. Not to mention is is 
            connected to a game store where I can buy the 
            rulebook for another tabletop RPG that I will 
            probably never play because I am addicted to 
            collecting them.

            There are multiple places that I want to visit.
            Some of them are far. Some of them are close.
            This table also includes the reasoning and what it
            would cost to visit these places.
