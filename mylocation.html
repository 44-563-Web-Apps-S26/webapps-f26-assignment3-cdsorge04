            My favorite place to visit has to be the Cardboard 
            Cafe in my hometown of Raymore Missouri. Its has 
            good waffles that I can enjoy while playing board 
            games with my friends. Not to mention is is 
            connected to a game store where I can buy the 
            rulebook for another tabletop RPG that I will 
            probably never play because I am addicted to 
            collecting them.
